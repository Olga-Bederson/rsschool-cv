## Personal Profile 
:----------:
### I`m motivated, adaptable and responsible person seeking a IT developer position. I have a methodical, customer-focused approach to work and a strong drive to see things through to completion. In my last job, I solved difficult legal tasks for my clients. Now I want to change my job. It seems to me in IT developer position I will be able to solve complicated problems, to learn a lot and develop my skills. I can to work in big or small teams, at the same time I know how to work solo. I studied JS for a 8 months, created CSS/HTML, JS, REACT JS projects and that's why I got a good experience for junior IT developer position.
